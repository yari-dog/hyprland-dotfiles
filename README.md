### dependencies
there's a lot of dependencies in the [dependencies file](dependencies), at some point i'll put them here, but not rn

### stow
honestly, my recommendation for managing dotfiles is with [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

it's a super simple program that symlinks it's contents to the parent directory of the directory it was invoked in

deadass just

``` 
> cd ~/

> git clone <repo>

> cd <repo>

> stow .
```

idk how stow handles pre-existing files but if you backup your existing config beforehand it can't hurt to try

you might need to rm the various directories included in this repo though, idk

## to note:
### AGS & GTK shit
my plan is to build the greeter & locker in AGS for the time being, as I need a useable development environment.
the locker would possibly be built using [gtk-session-lock](https://github.com/Cu3PO42/gtk-session-lock).
however, i do plan on switching to my own C based greeter & locker built with GTK, probably using my own locking system too. idk when that's gonna happen though

### emacs (puppymacs :3)
ill probably move this over to it's own repo soon, it feels weird keeping emacs in my regular dotfile repo but i don't want to deal with that rn

### directories, etc, etc
#### custom directories
`~/.cache/ags/user`
this holds generated scss files in the `generated/` directory.

`~/.local/state/ags`
`scss/` holds various scss files post-generation.

#### settings :3
at the moment, settings are modified with `.config/ags/settings/settings.json`
that's a big no-no in general, as it would mean settings would be wiped when pulling
at some point i'll move it to a "custom" file or something that gets created on first run, which would override what's default in settings.json

#### theme shit et al
right now, the theme is generated by [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal). I'll probably switch to [pywal-16-colors](https://github.com/eylles/pywal16) when it works on aur again.
wal's directory is `~/.cache/wal/`.
on generation, `colors.scss` is copied to `~/.cache/ags/user/generated/colors.scss`
then the pywal to material mapping is written to the end of `colors.scss`
`colors.scss` is then moved to `~/.local/state/ags/scss/_material.scss`.

the `sass` command that is run to generate the theme grabs definitions from:
`~/.local/state/ags/scss` & `~/.config/ags/scss`

it then compiles the scss using `~/.config/ags/scss/main.scss`

and outputs to `~/.cache/ags/user/generated/style.css`, which ags then uses.

## credits & thanks
- [end-4](https://github.com/end-4)

i have taken a lot of inspiration (and quite a bit of code) from end-4's hyprland dots setup.
i kinda just used it as an outline, as i didn't like some of the ways stuff was done there, and i used a LOT of it to actually learn how the fuck to use GTK and stuff
